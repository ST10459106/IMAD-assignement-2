# Rottweiler Tamagotchi Android App

This is an Android app that simulates taking care of a Rottweiler puppy in a Tamagotchi-style game. The user can feed, play with, and clean up after the virtual pet to keep it happy and healthy.

## How it Works

### Features:
- **Feed**: Clicking the feed button increases the pet's hunger level, simulating feeding the pet.
- **Play**: Clicking the play button increases the pet's happiness level, simulating playing with the pet.
- **Clean**: Clicking the clean button increases the pet's cleanliness level, simulating cleaning up after the pet.
- **Pet Stats**: The app displays the pet's current hunger, happiness, and cleanliness levels using progress bars and text.
- **Pet Image**: The app dynamically changes the pet's image based on its current state (happy, sad, or normal).

### Implementation:
- The app is implemented in Kotlin and utilizes Android's UI components like buttons, text views, and image views.
- Custom fonts are applied to the pet status text for a unique look.
- Toast messages provide feedback to the user when performing actions like feeding, playing, or cleaning.
- The pet's image changes dynamically based on its current state (happy, sad, or normal) and the action performed by the user.

## Comprehension Report

### Understanding the App:
- **Logic Flow**: Understanding the logic flow of the app was crucial to implementing the functionality correctly. Each button click triggers a specific action that updates the pet's stats and image accordingly.
- **UI Design**: Designing an engaging and welcoming UI was important to create an enjoyable user experience. Custom fonts, colors, and images were utilized to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

### GitHub's Functions in Perfecting the App:
- **Version Control**: GitHub provided version control, allowing for easy tracking of changes made to the codebase. This was particularly helpful when experimenting with different features and UI designs.
- **Collaboration**: GitHub enabled collaboration with team members, facilitating communication and sharing of ideas during the app development process.
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub's issue tracking feature allowed for the identification and resolution of bugs or issues encountered during development.
- **Pull Requests**: Pull requests were used to review and merge changes into the main codebase, ensuring code quality and stability.
- **Documentation**: GitHub's README.md file was used to provide documentation for the project, including a description of the app, its features, and how to use it. This helped users and contributors understand the purpose and functionality of the app.

### Conclusion:
GitHub's features such as version control, collaboration tools, issue tracking, pull requests, and documentation capabilities played a significant role in perfecting the app. They provided a structured framework for development, enabling efficient teamwork and ensuring the app met its objectives effectively.
